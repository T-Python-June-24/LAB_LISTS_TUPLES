# ## Movie Ratings Analysis

# Scenario:
# You have just been hired as a data analyst at a movie streaming platform. 
# Your manager has given you a list of movies, each with a tuple containing the movie title, release year, and user ratings. 
# The platform allows users to rate movies on a scale of 1 to 10. Your manager wants you to create a Python program that:

# 1. Accepts a list of movies, with each movie represented as a tuple containing the movie title, release year, and a list of user ratings.
# 2. Calculates the average rating for each movie.
# 3. Filters out movies with an average rating lower than 6.0.
# 5. Displays the  movies, along with their title, release year, and average rating.

# Example input:
# ```
# movies = [
#     ("The Shawshank Redemption", 1994, [9, 10, 10, 9, 8, 9]),
#     ("The Godfather", 1972, [10, 9, 8, 10, 9, 7]),
#     ("Pulp Fiction", 1994, [9, 8, 7, 8, 6, 5]),
#     ("The Dark Knight", 2008, [10, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8]),
#     ("Schindler's List", 1993, [8, 9, 9, 7, 6, 8]),
#     ("The Room", 2003, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1])
# ]
# ```

# Expected output:
# ```
# 1. The Shawshank Redemption (1994) - Avergae rating: 9.17 ★
# 2. The Godfather (1972) - Avergae rating: 8.83 ★
# 3. The Dark Knight (2008) - Avergae rating: 8.83 ★
# 4. Schindler's List (1993) - Avergae rating: 7.83 ★
# 5. Pulp Fiction (1994) - Avergae rating: 7.17 ★
# ```
